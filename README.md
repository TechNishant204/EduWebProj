TechNishant Course Hub is a modern, static website designed to serve as a dynamic platform for showcasing and promoting a wide range of online courses. Built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, the website emphasizes responsive design, accessibility, and user-friendly navigation, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

The website features a visually appealing layout with a gradient background and a glowing circle effect, creating an engaging and immersive user experience. Key functionalities include a search bar for users to easily find courses, a main-content section highlighting featured courses, and a top categories section to help users explore courses by subject or skill level.
