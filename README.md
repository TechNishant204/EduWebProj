<h2>📌Description of the Project</h2>
<p>
TechNishant Course Hub is a modern, static website designed to serve as a dynamic platform for showcasing and promoting a wide range of online courses. Built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, the website emphasizes responsive design, accessibility, and user-friendly navigation, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

The website features a visually appealing layout with a gradient background and a glowing circle effect, creating an engaging and immersive user experience. Key functionalities include a search bar for users to easily find courses, a main-content section highlighting featured courses, and a top categories section to help users explore courses by subject or skill level. Additionally, the website includes a testimonials section where students share their experiences, adding credibility and trustworthiness to the platform.

To keep users informed about new courses and updates, the website integrates a subscription form, allowing visitors to sign up for notifications. The footer is designed to enhance navigation, featuring links to different sections of the website, social media icons for connectivity, and copyright information to ensure transparency.

Accessibility is a core focus of the website, with features like screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation to ensure inclusivity for all users. The website is hosted on Netlify and is optimized for performance, ensuring fast load times and a smooth browsing experience.
